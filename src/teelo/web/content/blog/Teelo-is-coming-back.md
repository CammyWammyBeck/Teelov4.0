# Teelo is coming back

Teelo has been a work in progress for six and a half years. That is a long time to stay passionate about a project and, as it turns out, too long for me. However, I'm lucky enough to live in a city that hosts a Grand Slam (Melbourne), and while watching the Australian Open, the passion came back!

## Teelo is not back yet

I am rebuilding Teelo from the ground up. A lot of the code that I wrote myself six and a half years ago was still being used; it was bloated, out of date, and difficult to maintain. Along with that, the ATP website where data is extracted from had a major update that broke everything along the way.

Instead of banging my head against the wall trying to continuously update a codebase that was no longer fit for purpose, I decided to start from scratch to build something that is hopefully much more reliable.

## Teelo is going to be back with upgrades

Building the exact same thing I had before would be no fun. Instead, plenty of upgrades are already in the works:

- **Women's Tennis**: For the first time, women's tennis, including WTA, WTA 125, and Women's ITF data, will be included.
- **Upgraded ELO (maybe)**: I did a lot of work early on trying to find ways of building a smarter, more predictive ELO system to no avail. I'm trying again with new features like winning margin scaling, absence from play penalties, and new player scaling.
- **Website**: A website that not only displays all of Teelo's beautiful data but also tracks Teelo's predictive performance.

## Teelo is for everyone

Teelo (version 4) will focus on information for tennis fans. Statistics, graphs, records, ratings, rankings, etc. It will still make predictions, and down the line maybe compare those predictions to tennis markets, but that is not the priority right now.

## Teelo is when?

I have no date for when Teelo will be fully back. It is probably more helpful to give you an idea of the planned pipeline and where I am at on each point. I can tell you it isn't going to be another 6 years though. With AI at my fingertips, we are looking at weeks or months instead.

| Phase | Focus | Status |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Phase 1: Foundation** | Database schema, player identity, website scrapers, core ELO logic. | **Debugging** |
| **Phase 2: Data** | Scraping historical results and calculating base ratings. | **In Progress** |
| **Phase 3: Website** | Building this beautiful interface you are looking at now. | **Just Beginning** |
| **Phase 4: ML & Predictions** | Feature engineering and training models for match predictions. | **Planned** |
