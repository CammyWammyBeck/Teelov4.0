# Weekly Update — Building the Foundations for What’s Next

Big week for Teelo.

Right now the website is still in a very early stage, so most of this work is about building strong foundations for the features and tools I want to add over time.

## Faster updates in the background

I spent a lot of time improving how Teelo collects and processes data.

What this is building toward:

- faster updates as match and tournament results come in
- better reliability when more data is required
- more efficient data fetching to keep the website smooth

I also added better performance tracking, so I can spot bottlenecks early and keep improving speed as Teelo grows.

## Better handling of draw changes

Tournament draws can change late because of withdrawals and replacements.

This week, I improved how Teelo handles those changes so matchups stay accurate when a draw is updated.

I also improved how match states are tracked (for example, upcoming, in progress, and finished), which lays the groundwork for better filtering and clearer match pages as the website expands.

## Progress on ratings and predictions

I made an important improvement to the rating system that will power predictions.

Ratings can now be updated more directly as new matches are processed, with cleaner tracking of rating history in the database.

In short: this is foundation work, but it is important for building dependable predictions and deeper prediction features later on.

## Website progress (early stage)

The website is still early, but this week included several improvements that move us toward the bigger long-term experience:

- improved match browsing and filtering foundations
- clearer separation of upcoming and completed matches
- visual polish on badges, labels, and layout
- Grand Slam events are easier to identify
- simpler timezone handling

These updates are stepping stones. The goal is to keep layering on new features so Teelo becomes a much richer place for tennis fans to explore matches, trends, ratings, and predictions.

## Summary

This week was about strengthening the core systems and preparing the website for future growth.

You may notice some immediate quality improvements, but the bigger value is that this work sets up the next wave of features I’m planning to build.
